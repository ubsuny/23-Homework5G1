## Introduction:
The FFT essentially converts a signal from its time-based representation to its frequency-based representation, allowing us to dissect the signal into its fundamental frequencies. This process has broad applications across multiple fields, such as signal processing, engineering, and physics [[1]](https://www.nti-audio.com/en/support/know-how/fast-fourier-transform-fft). In the case of CO2 or methane data, applying FFT enables the understanding of recurring patterns or prominent frequencies in the dataset. It helps in uncovering cyclic behaviors or notable shifts in gas concentrations over time. By breaking down the data into its frequency components, the FFT reveals the waves needed to reconstruct the original signal. This is particularly valuable for recognizing cyclic trends, identifying significant frequencies, and eliminating unwanted noise from the dataset.
The Fourier Transform of a continuous-time signal \( x(t) \) is given by:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform)

X(f) = ∫<sub>-∞</sub><sup>∞</sup> x(t) ⋅ e<sup>-j2πft</sup> dt

where:
- \( X(f) \) is the complex amplitude of the signal in the frequency domain at frequency \( f \).
- \( x(t) \) is the time-domain signal.
- \( j \) is the imaginary unit.

The Inverse Fourier Transform is used to recover the original time-domain signal from its frequency-domain representation. For a continuous-time signal:

X(t) = ∫<sub>-∞</sub><sup>∞</sup> x(f) ⋅ e<sup>-j2πft</sup> df

## Data Selection
[[3] Data Station](https://gml.noaa.gov/dv/data/index.php?category=Greenhouse%2BGases&parameter_name=Carbon%2BDioxide&frequency=Monthly%2BAverages&search=sand+island): We have chosen the data of Sand Island, Midway, United States (MID) where air samples are collected in glass flasks.
## Project Objective:
The project is divided into three tasks.

#### Task 1: Calculate Actual Frequency
We have to implement a Python function for actual frequency in useful units based on the Fourier transform of a signal. The function should take frequencies and the Fourier transform of a signal, along with the sampling rate, and provide the actual frequency in a more interpretable form.

#### Task 2: Clean Up Noise in Time Domain
We have to develop a Python function that utilizes a combination of waveform modification techniques, including padding, windowing, FFT, inverse FFT, and undoing window+padding. This function should clean up either high or low-frequency noise in the time domain by zeroing the appropriate waveform coefficients in the frequency domain. Additionally, you need to plot both the "raw" and "cleaned" spectra in the time domain for visual comparison.

#### Task 3: Documentation, GitHub Actions, and Unit Tests
For this task, we have to complete the documentation for the implemented functions, reuse GitHub Actions for linting and unit tests, and write unit tests for Task 1 and Task 2.

## Filtering

Filtering refers to the process of selectively modifying or extracting certain components from a signal while attenuating or eliminating others. It is a fundamental concept in signal processing and is used in various fields such as audio processing, image processing, communication systems, and data analysis. The goal of filtering is often to enhance specific features of interest or to remove unwanted noise or interference [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)).

#### Types of Filters

1. **Low-pass Filter:**
   - Allows low-frequency components to pass through while attenuating high-frequency components.
   - Commonly used to smooth or remove high-frequency noise from a signal.

2. **High-pass Filter:**
   - Allows high-frequency components to pass through while attenuating low-frequency components.
   - Useful for extracting or enhancing high-frequency features in a signal.

#### Applications of Filtering

1. **Audio Processing:** Filtering is used in equalization to adjust the balance of different frequency components in audio signals.
2. **Image Processing:** Filtering is applied to enhance or suppress certain features in images.
3. **Communication Systems:** Filters are used to extract or eliminate specific frequency bands in signals for modulation, demodulation, and noise reduction.
4. **Biomedical Signal Processing:** Filtering is employed to remove noise and isolate specific physiological components from biomedical signals.

We have used high pass filter in our case to get the desired data. The graph is shown below:

## Windowing
Windowing is a technique used in signal processing to minimize the impact of discontinuities and artifacts that can occur when analyzing a finite segment (window) of a signal. It involves multiplying a signal by a window function, which is a mathematical function that is non-zero for only a finite interval[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function)
#### Main Goals of Windowing

The application of windowing in signal processing serves several important goals:

1. **Minimize Spectral Leakage:**
   - Windowing helps mitigate the impact of spectral leakage, which occurs when the frequency content of a signal extends beyond the boundaries of the analysis window. By tapering the signal at the edges, windowing reduces the leakage of energy into neighboring frequency bins.

2. **Reduce Side Lobe Amplitude:**
   - Another crucial goal of windowing is to reduce the amplitude of side lobes. Side lobes are undesired peaks in the frequency domain that can occur when analyzing a finite segment of a signal. Window functions, such as Hamming, Hanning, or Blackman, are designed to suppress side lobes, improving the accuracy of spectral analysis.

3. **Improve Frequency and Amplitude Estimation Accuracy:**
   - Windowing contributes to the accuracy of frequency and amplitude estimation. By minimizing spectral leakage and suppressing side lobes, windowing enhances the precision with which frequency and amplitude information can be extracted from the signal. This is particularly important in applications where accurate signal characterization is critical.

In summary, windowing is a fundamental technique aimed at refining the analysis of signals, ensuring more accurate and reliable results in various signal processing applications.

The obtained nature of graph after windowing is given below:
